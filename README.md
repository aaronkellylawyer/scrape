# scrape
So this project is a simple web scraper that would scrape a website or profile.  I added some more functionality by then allowing you to create a wordlist
 with all the words from the website. I"m working on adding more like finding frequency of certain words/phrases,  and if a phrase (i.e. a string of 2 or more words) is used more
 than once it would also add that to the list it would add it to the world list in the format its found in, as well as without spaces. 
 For future iterations I'd like to add the beautiful soup library and NLTK libary.
